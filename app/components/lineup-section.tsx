      fullBio:
        'Typhoon is an American indie rock band that originated in Salem, Oregon, and is now based in Portland. Formed in 2005 by high school friends Kyle Morton (singer-songwriter, piano, guitar), Toby Tanabe (bass, vocals), and Dave Hall (guitar, vocals), the band is known for its large and fluctuating membership, which has included up to fourteen musicians in the past.\n\nCharacterized by their orchestral arrangements and big-hearted indie rock anthems, Typhoon\'s sound often incorporates a traditional rock setup complemented by brass, strings, and auxiliary percussion. Lyrically, many of their songs delve into themes of mortality, partly influenced by frontman Kyle Morton\'s childhood struggle with Lyme disease.\n\nOver their career, Typhoon has released five studio albums, including their self-titled debut in 2005, "Hunger and Thirst" (2010), "White Lighter" (2013), "Offerings" (2018), and "Sympathetic Magic" (2021), as well as EPs like "A New Kind of House." Their most recent album, "Underground Complex No. 1," was released in 2022. The band has gained recognition for their dynamic live performances and has toured with notable acts such as The Decemberists, Belle and Sebastian, and The Shins. Key members, in addition to the founders, include drummer Alex Fitch and violinist/vocalist Shannon Steele.',

Formed by longtime creative partners Solange Igoa and Andrea Walker, the Portland-based band has built their career the analog way: a van, a map, and unforgettable shows stitched across towns like constellations. Their rise has been defined by raw connection and fearless self-expression, with music that fuses garage rock grit, new wave shimmer, southern Americana soul, and a dancefloor pulse — all tangled with heart and heat until what emerges is unmistakably, inimitably Glitterfox.\n\nNow joined by Eric Stalker and Blaine Heinonen, Glitterfox is more than a band — they're chosen family, held together by sound and the invisible threads that music always knows how to weave. Whether launching Portland's annual Glitterfest as a wedding reception or channeling the messy middle of life into something unforgettable, Glitterfox's gift is their transparency, their defiance, and their freedom — sung loud.",

Between 1999 and 2008, they released an EP and two full-length records.\n\nEric continued songwriting and performing around the Northwest, while Molly focused on raising their two sons.\n\nFlash forward to September 2022, when Ebon Bergeron approached Eric and asked if he'd want to add some guitar tracks to his drums. The result was a fast-moving expression of emotion and creativity. Both Eric and Ebon had been waiting for this moment, and it happened at just the right time.\n\nEnter Steve Doss, a recent transplant from California. Steve joined on standup bass, then Molly returned with backing vocals and percussion. MERCURY COAST was formed.\n\nWe have now built a solid local following and plan to release our first of 2 singles, Spring 2024. We look forward to making this world a better place through art and music. This is the time to feel the shine.",
